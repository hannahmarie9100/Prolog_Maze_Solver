## CS4337 Project 2 DevLog

December 12th -

- 3:54 - created the files in VS code
- 4:45 - added main comment explaining project workflow
- 4:58 - added comments explaining project flow
- 5:23 - I had some trouble going with my original workflow,
  so i ended up restarting with a new idea - I'm having some issues with git hub, my pushes are not reflecting onto GitHub anymore - I fixed the issues, and committed two new changes that were
  supposed to be separate, but i got them onto GitHub (5:48)
- 5:30 - I had some problems with figuring out how to accumulate actions in reverse order without going into infinite loops - fixed by using a visited list and accumulators
- 6:12 - finished up the validated maze functions, going to test before committing any changes
- 6:23 - tested all functions, had to make very minor changes like changing variable names but very minimal - 6:42 - completed all cell_at functions, going to test before committing
- 6:53 - tested all, looks pretty good. I don't believe there are any changes or edge cases I am missing.
- 10:18 - finished move and simulate_actions methods - had some trouble with the idea of simulate actions at first trying to write what i was thinking, took me about 20 minutes to fully understand
- 11:42 - finished last methods, completing README file and Devlog

Issues I encountered:

    - inconsistent variable naming
    - row-length validation confusion
    	- i accidentally kept calling the wrong methods for different reasons
    - DFS recursion confusion
    	- i had to relearn how to implement DFS specifically in Prolog
    - reversing action list
    - Git issues when I deleted most recent commit
    - restarted structure a couple times
